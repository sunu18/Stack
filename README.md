# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that allows data to be stored and retrieved in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. It can be thought of as a vertical stack of items, where the last item added is the first one to be removed.

The operations that can be performed on a stack include:

Push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the item at the top of the stack.
Peek: Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
Size: Return the number of items currently in the stack.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
Stacks can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, or dynamic arrays. Each implementation has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of time and space complexity, as well as ease of use.

Stacks have a wide range of applications in computer science, such as in compilers, operating systems, and web browsers. They are also commonly used in algorithms such as depth-first search, backtracking, and parsing. In addition, they are often used as a building block for other data structures, such as queues and hash tables.

Overall, stacks are a powerful and versatile data structure that can be used in many different contexts. By understanding the basic principles of stacks, you can write more efficient and effective code that takes advantage of their unique properties.
